Interview Q&A:
1. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-defined rules.

2. Stateful vs Stateless Firewall
Stateful: Remembers traffic state; tracks sessions.
Stateless: Checks each packet individually without memory.

3. Inbound vs Outbound Rules
Inbound: Controls traffic entering the system.
Outbound: Controls traffic going out from the system.

4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?
UFW provides a user-friendly CLI wrapper for iptables, making it easier to add rules without deep networking knowledge.

5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?
Telnet is unencrypted and insecure; blocking it prevents potential sniffing or brute-force attacks.

6. Common Firewall Mistakes
Leaving unnecessary ports open
Misconfigured rules blocking essential services
Forgetting to test firewall after rule changes

7. How does a firewall improve network security?
Firewalls filter malicious traffic, enforce policies, and act as a barrier between trusted and untrusted zones.

8. What is NAT in firewalls?
NAT (Network Address Translation) allows multiple devices to share a single IP and masks internal IPs, enhancing security.
